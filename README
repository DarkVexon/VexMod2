This mod changes a few things in Slay the Spire to my personal preference.

-Cursed Key now stops you from opening chests altogether.
-Dream Catcher's card reward only grants Upgraded cards.
-Potion Belt also comes with one free potion.
-Boot also makes you immune to Thorns and Sharp Hide.
-Blue Candle also draws 1 card when you play a Curse.
-Tiny House upgrades 2 random cards instead of 1.
-Nilry's Codex now grants 1 Strength per turn if you played a Rare card, instead of its old effect.
-Adds a new relic, the first content I ever made for Slay the Spire: Cursed Compass. An energy relic that makes the map one straight line.
-The event 'Note For Yourself' can no longer appear.
