This mod changes a few things I personally don't like about Slay the Spire.

-Cursed Key now stops you frop opening chests altogether.
-Gambling Chip now makes the first Skill you play on turn 1 get played twice.
-Dream Catcher's card reward only grants Upgraded cards.
-Potion Belt comes with one free potion.
-Boot makes you immune to Thorns and Sharp Hide.
-Blue Candle draws 1 card when you play a Curse.
-Tiny House upgrades 2 random cards instead of 1.
-Nilry's Codex grants 1 Strength per turn if you played a Rare card.
-Adds a new relic, the first content I ever made for Slay the Spire: Cursed Compass. An energy relic that makes the map one straight line.
